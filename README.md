# üï∫ Human Action Detection

This project focuses on classifying human activities (such as walking, jogging, sitting, etc.) from time-series accelerometer data. It applies machine learning models to predict human actions using sensor signals.

## üìå Project Workflow
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized and understood distributions, correlations, and trends in accelerometer signals.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Scaling using `StandardScaler` and `RobustScaler`
  - Encoding categorical labels
  - Handling class imbalance via resampling
- **Model Training:**
  - Trained multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- **Evaluation:**
  - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Best model achieved **96.91% accuracy, 96.74% precision, 95.84% recall, 96.28%  F1-score**

## üìä Results
The project demonstrates how different supervised learning models perform on time-series classification.  
The KNN model outperformed other algorithms with 96.7% accuracy on the test set, making it highly reliable for classifying human actions from sensor data.
